  title: Issue reporting API
  description: >
    Proposed API definition for issue reporting or feedback created initially for 6Aika cities. Based on Open311 Georeport V2 & CitySDK extensions.


    APIs conforming to this definition allow users to see all public feedback left to the organization, typically a city. Additionally pre-approved parties with API key can also leave feedback. All feedback contain title, description and, where applicable, location and image. This immediately allows for map based mashups, although the scope of uses need not to be so limited. Additionally, depending on organization, the feedback can contain information on how the feedback is being processed inside the organizations.


    The extensions to original Georeport V2 are marked as follows: for query parameters **bold** text indicates either CitySDK extension or 6Aika extension. Extension to the request response are split into separate models called request_georeport, request_citysdk and request_6aika. These correspond to the obvious sources.

    Note on terminology: Georeport V2 was originally designed for reporting issues that needed some kind of service action from the city. Thus the feedback is called "service request" and the API endpoint is named /requests. In this specification requests are used for all kinds of feedback. Situation is similar with "service request type" and /services endpoint. Services are used to optionally categorize feedback.

This could also be a URL to a media RSS feed where the clients can parse for media in a more structured way.
